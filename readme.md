Etch-A-Sketch

This is an etch-a-sketch project for The Odin Project. The aim I believe is to make squares that transition into black when you hover/click over them. I am excited to get started with this project, I believe it is going to push me a lot, these are the times you learn the most!

Etch-A-Sketch finished! This project was a step up compared to the rock-paper-scissors project but I am glad I did it in a much more reasonable amount of time. There are a lot of things I had to loop up for this project But the result is something I am proud of. The slider function is something that I wanted to add but I was unsure how to add a popup window to display the grid size it is choosing. I left it just because it kinda works and it's a neat additon. W3Schools had a tutorial for the slider and thats what I followed. CSS-Tricks had a tutorial on the ripple animation for buttons and I thought that added a nice visual represntation for when the button gets clicked. Like I said a lot needed to be googled, but I managed to cobble it all together! Proud of this one!
